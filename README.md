# pfw

Proprietarity no more!   

### What?

PFW is an embeddable JavaScript library for building dynamic, fluent programming languages with assistance along the way.

### Why?

*Some* hatred for NuGet, NPM and many other package managers for various programming languages, requiring memorization or proprietary GUI usage.   
*Some* hatred for languages with specific VMs/runtimes (i.e. Java).   
And *some* hatred for ANTLR (which tends to be one of the jankiest parsing frameworks).
